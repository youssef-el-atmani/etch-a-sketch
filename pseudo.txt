##Plan##
    create a universal container that will contain:
        btn             : For setting the grid size by user
        boxes-container   : That will contain the tiny-boxes
                            Its size 960px*960px

        Note: they will be aligned vertically,
              they will be centered

    
    box-container  will INITIALLY have 16*16 grid
    WHEN the box-container will be hovered
        the hovered tiny-boxes will changed their color to black

    WHEN user will click on "RESIZE btn", and enter a number that: 0 < num <= 100
        the Grid will have the (num*num) resolution

## PseudoCode ##
    *HTML*
        Create a universal container
            Create a button and name it "RESIZE"
                add a class to it named "resize"
            Create a div, and give it a "boxesContainer" class

    *JS*
        create a const var named resizingBtn and initialize it with the "btn element"
        create a const var named boxesContainer and initialize it with the "boxesContainer-elem"
        create a const array named wideBoxesHolder that will store the wide boxes

        create a function named createGrid that takes a positive integer num as argument.
            that function, creates num*num grid inside the boxesContainer element
            also, make each tiny-box responsive to hovering
                when hovered: change the color to "black"

        call createGrid() with "16"


        define createGrid() that will take num as an argument
            FOR num times
                creates a wideBox
                add necessary classes to that wideBox
                    For num times
                        create a tiny-box
                        add the necessary classes to it
                        add the responsive behavior for tiny-box
                        append that tiny-box in the current wideBox
                    EndFor
            EndFor

            Iterate over wideBoxesHolder array
                append each wide-box to boxesContainer
            
    

#Notes#
change .boxesContainer to ID, and give it white background

#Grid Resize#
    HTML:create a button and give it a class "resize"
    create a const named resizeBtn

    create a var named gridSize
    when that button clicked
        remove all the wideBoxes from the DOM
        Free Up the wideBoxesHolder array
        get newGrid size from user
            and store it in gridSize var
        Call the createGrid() function
            pass to it `gridSize` as argument
