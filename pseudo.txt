##Plan##
    create a universal container that will contain:
        btn             : For setting the grid size by user
        boxes-container   : That will contain the tiny-boxes
                            Its size 960px*960px

        Note: they will be aligned vertically,
              they will be centered

    
    box-container  will INITIALLY have 16*16 grid
    WHEN the box-container will be hovered
        the hovered tiny-boxes will changed their color to black

    WHEN user will click on "RESIZE btn", and enter a number that: 0 < num <= 100
        the Grid will have the (num*num) resolution
